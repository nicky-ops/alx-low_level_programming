## Learning Objectives
### General
* What is a search algorithm
An algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrive information stored within a particular data structure

* What is a linear search
It checks every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion.

* What is a binary search
It repeatedly targets the center of the search structure and divides the search space in half.

* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
The appropriate search algorithm to use often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data.
