# ** C - Bit manipulation **
* Bitwise operators perform operations on a bit level. 
* Bitwise operators are binary OR(|), binary AND(&), binary XOR(^), binary LEft Shift Operator(<<) and binary Right Shift Operator(>>).

## Task 0
* COnvert a binary number to an unsigned int

## Task 1
* Print the binary representation of a number

## Task 2
* Return the value of a bit at a given index.

## Task 3
* Set the value of a *bit* to 1 at a given index

## Task 4
* Set the value of a bit to 0 at a given index

## Task 5
* Return the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another
