# C - Function pointers
Function pointers points to code not data. It stores the start of executable code.
A function pointer cannot be used to allocate or de-allocate memory.
Like in pointers, we can have an array of function pointers.
Function pointers can be passed as an argument and can also be returned from a function.
Function pointers can be used to avoid code redundancy.
