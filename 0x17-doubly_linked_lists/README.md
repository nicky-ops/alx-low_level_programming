# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists
A doubly linked list is a data structure in C that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to hte next node inthe sequence. 
A doubly linked list allows traversal in both directions.

## Tasks
### 0. Print list
Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.
* Prototype: size_t print_dlistint(const dlistint_t *h);
* Return: the number of nodes

### 1. List length
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.

* Prototype: size_t dlistint_len(const dlistint_t *h);
