# More malloc, free
The malloc function is used to allocate a certain amount of memory during the execution of a program. It will request a block of memory from the heap. If the request is granted, the operating system will reserve the requested amount of memory and malloc will return a pointer to the reserved space.
This project is a continuation of malloc and free.
It covers how to use the exit function as well as how to use calloc and realloc.
