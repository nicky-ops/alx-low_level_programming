# 0x13. C - More singly linked lists
Linked List is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node is divided into two sections that hold data and the address of the successive node, stored at the random address in the memory.
* Data in linked lists is stored at random locations and easily accessed using the addresses by which they are linked together.
* The last address of the last node points to *NULL*
