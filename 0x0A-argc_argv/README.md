# C - argc, argv
The name of the variable argc stands for "argument count"; argc contains the number of arguments passed to the program. The name of the variable argv stands for "argument vector". A vector is a one-dimensional array, and argv is a one-dimensional array of strings. Each string is one of the arguments that was passed to the program.

## Command Line Arguments
Command line arguments are very useful. Adding the capability to pass arguments to programs makes them more useful.
Arguments passed on to the command line end up as arguments to the main function.
